Heart Disease Prediction Project - Viva Notes

1. Project Summary
------------------
- Goal: Predict heart disease from medical features using ML
- Dataset: Balanced heart.csv (13 features, binary target)
- App: Built using Streamlit, includes EDA, prediction form, and conclusion

2. Project Steps
------------------
Step 1: Loaded dataset
Step 2: EDA - target distribution, heatmap, boxplot, gender analysis, pairplot
Step 3: Preprocessing - StandardScaler + stratified train/test split
Step 4: Trained RandomForestClassifier
Step 5: Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score
Step 6: Saved model and scaler
Step 7: Built Streamlit app with input form + visual summary

3. Streamlit Features
------------------
- Shows EDA charts: countplot, heatmap, boxplots, gender vs target
- Shows describe() table and pairplot image
- Form takes 13 inputs from user
- Scales input, predicts using model, shows live result
- Conclusion section highlights feature insights

5. Viva Questions & Answers
------------------
Q1. Why this dataset?
-> It's clean, public, and suitable for binary classification.

Q2. What is the target column?
-> 'target' (0 = no heart disease, 1 = has heart disease)

Q3. Why did you scale the data?
-> So that all features have similar range for fair modeling.

Q4. What is stratify in train_test_split?
-> Keeps class balance (0 and 1) in train and test sets.

Q5. Why Random Forest model?
-> Accurate, handles small data well, low overfitting.

Q6. How did you evaluate the model?
-> Confusion matrix and classification report.

Q7. What was your model accuracy?
-> 100% on small balanced test set.

Q8. What are top 3 important features?
-> Chest pain (cp), max heart rate (thalach), ST depression (oldpeak)

Q9. How does your Streamlit app work?
-> Takes input → scales → predicts → shows result with EDA and summary

Q10. What was your conclusion?
-> Males had slightly higher risk. Some features like cp, thalach, oldpeak were strong indicators.
